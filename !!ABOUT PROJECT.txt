Hello,
My name is Denis Sinkevich. This is my exam project of JavaScript course.

You can start this SPA with help some commands - 'npm run start' and 'npm run j',
because you need to use http and json servers to display site.  

SPA opportunities:
  * Message board:
	- add new anonymous announcement (without registration);
	- add new private announcement (with registration);
	- see list of all buying products
	- see product's definition on single-product page
	- look at announcements with help search panel
	- filter all announcements with help sidebar panel

  * Users:
	- registrate new user
	- login as registrated user
	- see own private announcements
	- delete private announcement
